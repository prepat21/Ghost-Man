Play Ghost Man !



It's a spin on Pac-Man where Pac-Man usually tries to avoid the ghosts but if you saw the movie Pixels, Pac-Man is actually a bad guy.



Use 3 different pathfinding algorithms:

     - Dijkstra's: A weighted algorithm that is a variation of Breadth First Search

     - A* Search: An extension Dijstra's but utilizes more indepth total cost analysis

     - DFS: A basic Depth First Search

  
  
You can even modify the map with randomly generated mazes that have walls.



You can add an invisible mine somewhere in the map and see what happens.



More functionality will be coming to the game so stay tuned!
